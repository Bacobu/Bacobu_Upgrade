<h1>Protecting your Business from Spam, Malware, and Viruses</h1>
</div>

<div class="fixedwidthparagraph">
<p>It is becoming increasingly important to have comprehensive computer security, especially for businesses. Customers depend upon businesses to keep their information secure, but all too often we hear reports about how even giants such as Target fail to withstand infiltration by those with enough technical knowledge and determination. With the rapid evolution of technology, protecting your business’s data can begin to look like a daunting task. Luckily, there are some simple steps you can take to help prevent a problem.</p>

<p>First, you or an employee within your technology department should research the current antivirus programs that are available. Go to the antivirus’s company websites and look for independent reviews of both the antivirus itself and the company’s customer service. As you research, you should keep the model and Operating System version of your computers, as well as the way you use them in mind. You need to be sure that you pick not only the best antivirus, but some form of protection from other malware, including a firewall, and versions that will work properly with your devices.</p>

<p>Secondly, to prevent worms, which can spread very quickly, you must keep all of your devices updated with the most current patches for each of the programs installed on them. Worms attack weaknesses in programs that can only be repaired with these patches, so though it is tempting to procrastinate these updates should be prioritized.</p>

<p>Third, you must be sure that the email provider you select for your company is one with good security. Some website hosting companies do not include much security at all with the email accounts they provide, so you should check what yours includes. Make sure there is a good spam filter. It would be best if it was dynamic. Some email providers also hide anything that could possibly pose a threat, even to the point of overdoing it, unless you mark it as safe.</p>

<p>Fourth, you will have to educate all of your employees who have access to your computers about security. Many of them will have heard some of it before, but most of them won’t know the details unless they work in technology. If you can, make it a fun, interesting, and interactive discussion or game rather than holding a meeting or showing them a few hundred PowerPoints. It would be best to explain dictionary attacks and related mischief rather than simply telling employees to use strong passwords. Show them printed examples of spam and phishing attacks. Odds are, someone within your company has had a problem with one in the past and could relate their experience to others, making it more real to their coworkers. Make sure that they are informed that these attacks now include phone calls.</p>

<p>You must also explain that websites that have been blocked by the antivirus or your technology department are blocked to protect the computers, and that attempts to get around the block will not be tolerated. Employees can always speak with a representative from the technology department if they believe they need to access a blocked site.</p>

<p>Finally, it is important to continue doing research. Technology evolves quickly, as does the variety of ways it can be attacked. There are many potential news sources that could keep you abreast of the latest weaknesses, attacks, or to help you figure out whether you have a problem if something seems to be a bit off. Keep an open line of communication with your staff and technology department so everyone is up to date.</p>
