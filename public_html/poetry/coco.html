<h2><u>Coco</u></h2>
<h4>October 07, 2014</h4>
<h5>Color Poem for Literary Genres</h5>

<p>
As fairytales ended,<br /> 
That&#8217;s how I found you.<br />
But more honestly said,<br />
You found me.<br />
<br />
Liquid chestnut ran from your eye<br />
As you leapt at me<br />
Joyously heading me home.<br />
<br />
Chocolate became your<br />
Poison and your perseverance,<br />
Your skill, name, claim to fame.<br />
<br />
From humble cardboard beginnings,<br />
You came.<br />
That tan flag,<br />
The helicopter propeller you flew<br />
Guided us, your charges,<br />
Home.<br />
<br />
Sturdy, unstreamlined, enduring, and kind,<br />
Miles of shell laden sand removed,<br />
Gigantic hairy beasts kept at bay,<br />
Children caught, tears turned to warmth,<br />
Soil strewn joyously to the sky.<br />
<br />
There, dependable you were.<br />
The brown and black princess,<br />
Queen of the Nile.<br />
<br />
Leave blue to the sky,<br />
It envies your richness.<br />
